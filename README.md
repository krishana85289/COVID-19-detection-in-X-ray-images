# COVID-19 Detection in X-ray Images

This repository contains code and data for detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images using machine learning.

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in demand for fast and accurate diagnostic tools. X-ray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool for respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. In this project, we develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect COVID-19 in X-ray images.

## Data

We use a publicly available dataset of X-ray images that includes both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. The dataset is available from [source](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).

## Model

We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify X-ray images as COVID-19 or non-COVID-19. The model is implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, you will need to install the required Python libraries and download the dataset. See the `requirements.txt` file for a list of required libraries.

## Results

Our model achieves an accuracy of 95% on the test set, with a precision of 93% and a recall of 98%.

## Conclusion

We have developed a machine learning model for detecting COVID-19 in X-ray images with high accuracy. This model has the potential to be a useful tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
